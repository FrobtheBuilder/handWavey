    description: Set this to -1 when you need to invert X (side to side). You'll typicall
      only need to do this if your device is upside down. On newer LeapSDK versions,
      this may become obsolete.

  yMultiplier:
    defaultValue: '1'
    description: Set this to -1 when you need to invert Y (up and down). You'll typicall
      only need to do this if your device is upside down. On newer LeapSDK versions,

  zMultiplier:
    defaultValue: '-1'
    description: Set this to -1 when you need to invert Z (how far away from you your
      hand goes). UltraMotion takes care of this for you. So I can't currently think
      of a use-case for it, but am including it for completeness.
