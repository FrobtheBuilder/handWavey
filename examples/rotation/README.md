# Rotation examples

This is for when you want to logically rotate the input. There are two reasons why you might want to do this:

* You want to move your hand like you would with a traditional mouse. See [horizontal](horizontal/).
* You want to mount the device to the side of your desk. See [sideMount](sideMount/).
