# horizontal rotation

In testing with real world users, some people have expressed that it would be easier to use if you moved your hand like a traditional mouse. This configuration does that.

## Considerations

I'm skeptical that this is a good way to use it. My gut feeling is that it will make your arm, shoulder, and back tired more quickly, and may be more likely to result in strain.

**You have been warned.**

## Mappings

This configuration maps depth movement of the hand (how far away it is away from you) to vertical movement of the cursor, and horizontal (y) movement of the hand to horizontal movement of the cursor.

The remaining vertical movement of the hand maps to zones.
