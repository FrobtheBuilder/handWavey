# Just secondary

Very similar to the default configuration, except that it only does it for the secondary hand. This is because you don't use the secondary hand any where near as often, and it's often not obvious whether you're making the desired gesture until you take action, which could lead to mistakes.

This aims to solve that by helping you hear when you are making the gesture that you want.

I suggest starting with the default, and then moving to this once you've mastered the default.
