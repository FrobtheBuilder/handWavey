# piano/firstAttempt

Gives you audio feedback for everything you do using piano notes.

The big advantage of this is that you can hear very precisely which combinations of gesture states you are currently in. Having said that, the secondary hand is currently a duplicate of the primary hand... This feels like a hugely missed opportunity. I'm sure that creatives could [have fun making better layouts](https://github.com/ksandom/handWavey/pulls).

This is my first attempt at such a layout. This can be done better, and I welcome [pull requests](https://github.com/ksandom/handWavey/pulls).
