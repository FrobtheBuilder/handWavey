# touchScreen

This was the first way of interacting with handWavey. It was a bad idea, but is fun to look back on.

If you do play with this, pay attention to how stiff your arm gets, and stop before you injure yourself.

## Using it

* Your hand movements are mapped 1:1 to the movement of the cursor (absolute zone).
* Move your hand deeper (close to the screen) to move into the relative zone to have more fine control.
