# Hand cutout

This is a very basic cutout that you can use to help the Ultraleap device recognise your feet.

## Instructions

1. Choose with, or without straps.
2. Print it out.
3. Cut out around the lines.
4. Attach it to your foot.
    * If you use the straps, you'll want to use something to keep them closed. Eg:
        * Paper clip.
        * Sticky velcrow to stick to the socks.
        * Sticky goo for sticking up notices (eg Blutack).
    * It's worth wearing a black sock underneath to mask your foot from view.
