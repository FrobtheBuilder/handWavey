# grabClick

## Using it

* Hold your hand in a relaxed, almost flat position.

## The Gestures

* Clicks
    * Click: Tilt your hand off to the side it naturally wants to turn.
    * Right click: Tilt you hand to the side it less naturally wants to turn, but only a little past flat.
    * Middle click: Close your hand, then tilt to the side it naturally wants to turn.
    * Double click: Touch the action zone.
* Scroll: Hand in neutral position. Close your hand.
* Keys <!-- (nice to haves) -->
    * CTRL: Introduce secondary hard. Tilt slightly opposite of natural direction.
    * ALT: Introduce secondary hard. Keep relatively flat.
    * Shift: Introduce secondary hard. Tilt in natural direction to almost vertical.

## Considerations

* Dragging over larger areas is currently unreliable.

## Target audience

Most people?

This is meant to

* be easier to click repetitively with less impact on your wrist.
* be a more relax way to hold your hand.
