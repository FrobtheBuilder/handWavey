# tiltClick-doubleClick

## Using it

* Hold your hand in a relaxed, almost flat position.

## The Gestures

* Clicks
    * Click: Tilt your hand off to the side it naturally wants to turn.
    * Right click: Tilt your hand slightly unnaturally.
    * Middle click: Close your hand, then tilt to the side it naturally wants to turn.
    * Double click: 
      * Touch the action zone.
      * Hand in neutral position. Close your hand. Rotate slightly unnaturally.
* Scroll: Hand in neutral position. Close your hand. Move hand up/down.
* Keys <!-- (nice to haves) -->
    * CTRL: Introduce secondary hard. Tilt slightly unnaturally.
    * ALT: Introduce secondary hard. Keep relatively flat.
    * Shift: Introduce secondary hard. Tilt in natural direction to almost vertical.

## Considerations

* Dragging over larger areas is currently unreliable.

## Target audience

Most people?

This is meant to

* be easier to click repetitively with less impact on your wrist.
* be a more relax way to hold your hand.

## Terminology

### Rotating naturally vs unnaturally

If you hold you hand in front of you so that it's flat with palm facing down. Now rotate it to have the palm facing up. You have rotated your hand naturally.

If you now hold up your hand again with the palm facing down and now rotate your hand in the other direction, there is only a small amount of comfortable movement before you either start straining, or have to raise your elbow.

The segments have been rotated slightly to make it easier to achieve the unnatural turn without hurting yourself.

## Logic

### Segments

There are 8 segments (0-7):

* 0 is slightly more relaxed than normal, so not completely flat. This is the default position.
* 1 is rotating the hand naturally to make a click.
* 7 is rotating the hand slightly in the opposite direction to natural to achieve a right click or zoom.
