    description: 'Int: Which finger to use to determine that the hand is open or closed.
      If you are having incorrect open/closed state, this is the first thing to check.
      Have a look at the "Leap Motion Diagnostic Visualizer" to see what every finger
      is doing when you see the incorrect behavior. On the devices that I''ve tested
      so far, finger 1 and 2 (pointing and index) are regularly in the incorrect state,
      while other fingers seem to be fine.'
