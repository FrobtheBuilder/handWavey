# Move your hand more like a mouse

In testing with real world users, some people have expressed that it would be easier to use if you moved your hand like a traditional mouse.

There is now a configuration example for this in [examples/rotation/horizontal](https://github.com/ksandom/handWavey/tree/main/examples/rotation/horizontal). Please read the considerations section of the documentation on that page.
