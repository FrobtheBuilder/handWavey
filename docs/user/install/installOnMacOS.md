# Install on macOS

At the time of this writing, I don't have a macOS machine to experiment with, so I suggest starting with the [Linux instructions](installOnLinux.md) and see how close that gets you.

There is an [open ticket](https://github.com/ksandom/handWavey/issues/1) to address this, and help would be very welcome.
