# Example configurations

There are lots of [examples](https://github.com/ksandom/handWavey/tree/main/examples) that show you how to achieve various things with handWavey. In most cases you can simply drop the files into your [configuration directory](https://github.com/ksandom/handWavey/blob/main/docs/user/configuration/whereIsMyConfigurationDirectory.md) and restart handWavey.

If you stuff up, you can simply delete the relevant/all handWavey config files, restart handWavey, and you'll get a default configuration again.

You may want to back up your configuration before getting started ;)
