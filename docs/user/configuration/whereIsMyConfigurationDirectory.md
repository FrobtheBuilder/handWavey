# Where is my configuration directory?

It's created during the first run of handWavey, and the configuration files are created at the same time.

## Linux

`~/.config/handWavey`

You can see it explicitly with

```bash
echo ~/.config/handWavey
```

And see the files inside it with

```bash
ls ~/.config/handWavey
```

## Mac

Same as Linux?


## Windows

`%USERPROFILE%\handWavey`

You can see it explicitly with

```
echo %USERPROFILE%\handWavey
```

And see the files inside it with

```
dir %USERPROFILE%\handWavey
```
